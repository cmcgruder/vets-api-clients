# Sandbox test accounts for VA Lighthouse APIs

Lighthouse provides test accounts and data you can use to make sure your integration works as planned. These test accounts are specific to each API and login method. Both ID.me and Login.gov connect to sandbox-api.va.gov. If you use Login.gov, youâ€™ll need an application that generates multi-factor authentication codes, such as Google Authenticator or Authy.

**Do not modify any of the attributes for these test accounts, including passwords.** If you need to use one of these accounts for a different use case, [contact us](https://developer.va.gov/support/contact-us) on our developer portal.
