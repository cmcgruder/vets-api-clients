# Sandbox Test Accounts for VA Lighthouse APIs

Lighthouse provides test accounts and data you can use to make sure your integration works as planned. These test accounts are specific to each API. They can be used to log in to the ID.me sandbox environment, which is connected to sandbox-api.va.gov.

**Do not modify any of the attributes for these test accounts, including passwords.** If you need to use one of these accounts for a different use case, [contact us](https://developer.va.gov/support/contact-us) on our developer portal.

## Logging in with ID.me

To log in to the sandbox environment using ID.me, make sure you:

  1. Choose an account that is specific to the API you want to test.
  2. Select **ID.me** to sign in to the sandbox environment.
  3. Enter the ID.me username and password (**Password1234!**).
  4. **Don’t change any preselected answers** when asked about receiving an authentication code. Just click “Continue” to go to the next step.

## Logging in with Login.gov

To log in to the sandbox environment using Login.gov, make sure you:

  1. Choose an account that is specific to the API you want to test.
  2. Select **Login.gov** to sign in to the sandbox environment.
  3. Enter the Login.gov username and password (**Password12345!!!**).
  4. Use the Login.gov MFA seed to generate a 2FA code using an application like Google Authenticator or Authy.
