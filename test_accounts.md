# Sandbox Test Accounts for VA Lighthouse APIs

Lighthouse provides test accounts and data you can use to make sure your integration works as planned. These test accounts are specific to each API. They can be used to log in to the ID.me sandbox environment, which is connected to sandbox-api.va.gov.

To log in to the sandbox environment with a test account, make sure you:

  1. Choose an account that is specific to the API you want to test.
  2. Use ID.me to sign in to the sandbox environment.
  3. **Don’t change any preselected answers** when asked about receiving an authentication code. Just click “Continue” to go to the next step.

**Do not modify any of the attributes for these test accounts, including passwords.** If you need to use one of these accounts for a different use case, [contact us](https://developer.va.gov/support/contact-us) on our developer portal.
