# Sandbox Test Accounts for VA Lighthouse APIs

Lighthouse provides test accounts for use while developing against the various API offerings.  These test accounts are API-specific.  Select the category of interest below for more information.

These test accounts may be used to log into the ID.me sandbox environment that is connected to sandbox-api.va.gov. When signing in with a test account, Step 2 will ask how you want to receive an authentication code. Click "continue" for the verification to be automatically populated in Step 3.

**Do not modify any of the attributes for these test accounts, including passwords.** If you need to use one of these accounts for a different use case, [contact VA Lighthouse Support](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/issues/new/choose).
