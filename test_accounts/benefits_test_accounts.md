# Sandbox test accounts for benefits and appeals APIs

These test users have a variety of synthetic VA records and can be used to test the following benefits-related APIs: 
* [Benefits Claims API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/claims?version=current) 
* [Decision Reviews API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/decision-reviews/docs?version=current)

Power of Attorney (POA) test accounts are also available [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/blob/master/test_accounts/benefits_test_accounts.md#Representative).

**To use this test data**
1. Find the test accounts that meet your use case from the table below.

## Test Accounts with Health Data

These test users have both Claims data and Health data and may be used in both the Claims API and Health API.

## Representatives

There are two test users, Tamara Ellis and John Doe, who are accredited and can be assigned Power of Attorney (POA) for specific Veterans. They can be used to test the [Benefits Claims API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/claims?version=current). During the authentication process, we look up the Office of General Counsel (OGC) POA code associated with the Veteran and validate that the Representative has a matching POA code.

**Both Veterans and non-Veterans can be Representatives.**

Tamara Ellis, test user 001, is a Veteran. John Doe, test user 007, is not. Both can be assigned POA for any of the above Veterans, if not already. If the Representative attempts to read or write data for a Veteran test user they do not have POA for, the server will return a `401 Unauthorized` error.

**Note:** Power of attorney is live within the sandbox environment. The power of attorney for each Veteran can, and will, change throughout the day.
Please utilize the [POST /forms/2122](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/claims?version=current#operations-Power_of_Attorney-post2122) endpoint  to update the Veteran's POA before attempting Representative interactions.

### Representative POA Codes

The following are POA codes associated with both Tamara Ellis and John Doe in sandbox:

 - `095`, `074`, `083`, and `1NY`

These codes are associated with Veteran Service Organizations and designate Tamara and John as Representatives operating through those organizations. Any of these POA codes can be assigned to any Veteran in sandbox to then make calls as Tamara Ellis or John Doe on behalf of that Veteran.

There are also unique POA codes for Tamara and John when assigning them to act as POA in an _individual_ capacity:

- Tamara Ellis: `067`
- John Doe: `072`
